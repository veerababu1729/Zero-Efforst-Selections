# Zero-Efforst-Selections
Researched and  implemented a flutter food ordering app for eatsure hiring challenge in which user can select and order the food with zero efforts without any endless searching just like reels. Designed the best recommendation algorithm for this reel like feature to suggest best food based on 4 time zones:
1.Morning
2.Afternoon
3.Evening
4.Night
Each time zone has 6 parameters:
     High rated, most bought in last 2 hrs., relevance(customer data, past orders), best seller, best offers, random
workflow: "This algorithm feeds the user with 6 categories. Then takes user engagement feed and updates the
feed dynamically such that user can relate to the feed up to max level and places order at some point."
Impact: increases sales, reduces 50% user time and efforts in food selection.
Technology: Flutter, Firestore database.
